## 🧠 How the AI Works

WarKlas AI utilizes a robust **System Prompt** designed specifically for career architecture. 
- **Context-Aware Routing**: Based on the user's uploaded images or text inputs, it routes the query to the best available model.
- **Vision Parsing**: Images are first passed through Hugging Face's `Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct` model to extract text and context, which is then fed into the conversational LLM.
- **Roadmap Generation**: The LLM is instructed to output standard `mermaid` markdown syntax when a user asks for a plan, which the frontend automatically renders into interactive diagrams.
